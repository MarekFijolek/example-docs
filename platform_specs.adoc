The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. They don’t want us to eat. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Another one. Eliptical talk. Special cloth alert. Hammock talk come soon. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. Cloth talk. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.

Stay focused. They don’t want us to win. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me.
